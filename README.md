# Gym-memberships-A-B-test

For this project I was helping a fancy (hypothetical) gym run an A/B test. 
Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer
Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application

Managerâ€™s hypothesis was that visitors assigned to Group B are more likely to purchase a membership.
In this project I manipulated data with Python, SQL queries, Pandas and visualised the results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Results:

5004 visitors were assigned to the groups A and B, 2504 and 2500 respectively.

Only 11.49% of all visitors fill out an application, from which visitors who don't take a fitness test with a personal trainer are significantly more likely to apply.


Of those who picked up an application, there's no significant difference in purchased a membership. Applicants of both groups are more likely to make a purchase (around 80%).


However, the test showed that among all visitors, those who take a fitness test are less likely to buy memberships with a significant difference of 2.1%.


Manager's hypothesis that visitors assigned to Group B are more likely to purchase a membership confirmed.
