# Gym-memberships-A-B-test

For this project I acheived assisting a fancy (hypothetical) gym run an A/B test.
Group A was asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer and
Group B skipped the fitness test and proceed directly to the application

The managerâ€™s hypothesis was that visitors assigned to Group B are more likely to purchase a gym membership.

In this project I successfully manipulated the data supplied using Python, SQL queries, Pandas and visualised the results with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### Results:

5004 visitors were assigned to the groups A and B, 2504 and 2500 respectively.

Only 11.49% of all visitors fill out an application, from which those who don't take a fitness test with a personal trainer are significantly more likely to apply.

Of those who picked up an application, there's no significant difference in purchasing a membership. Applicants of both groups are more likely to make a purchase, around 80%.

However, the test showed that among all visitors, those who take a fitness test are less likely to buy memberships with a significant difference of 2.1%.

The manager's hypothesis that visitors assigned to Group B are more likely to purchase a membership is confirmed.
